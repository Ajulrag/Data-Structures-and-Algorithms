GRAPH
-----------------------------

=> A graph is a non-linear data structure.

=> That consist of a finite number of vertices (also called nodes) connected by edges.

=> We can say trees are a specific type of graph data structure.

Types:-
    1. Directed :-
    -------------
        -> A graph in which the edges have a direction (A -> B -> c).
        -> Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed. 
    
    2. Undirected :-
    ---------------
        -> A graph in which the edges are bidirectional (A - B - C).
        -> A graph can be traversed in either direction.
        -> The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is Undirected.

GRAPH
-----------------------------

=> A graph is a non-linear data structure.

=> That consist of a finite number of vertices (also called nodes) connected by edges.

=> We can say trees are a specific type of graph data structure.

Types:-
    1. Directed :-
    -------------
        -> A graph in which the edges have a direction (A -> B -> c).
        -> Edges are usually represented by arrows pointing in the direction the graph can be traversed. 
    
    2. Undirected :-
    ---------------
        -> A graph in which the edges are bidirectional (A - B - C).
        -> A graph can be traversed in either direction.
        -> The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is Undirected.

Type of Graph
--------------------
o Null graph        : When there is no edge is there.
o Trivial graph     : When graph have only one node.
o Undirected graph  : Bi-direction of edge.
o Directed graph    : Edges have the directions
o Cycle graph       : Degree of each vertex us two.
o Cyclic graph      : Graph contain at least on cycle
o Weighted graph    : graph which has cost of travel to another vertex.
o Connected graph
o Disconnected graph


Implementaion of Graph
------------------------
The graph can be implemented in two ways
-> Adjacency matrix
-> Adjacency list

HEAP
-------------------------

=>In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.

LINKEDLLIST
-----------------------------------

=> Linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.

=> Each node consists of a value and a pointer,that pointer points to the next node.

=> Itâ€™s not a continuous memory allocation. 

=> So traversal is necessary to access value.

=> 3 types:

    1.Singly linked list :
           o Each node containes a value and  a pointer. That pointer holds the address of the next node.
           o And the last node contains a value and a null value.

    2.Doubly linked list :
           o Each node contains a value and two pointers. 
           o A pointer points to the next node and the other one points to the previous node.

    3.Circular linked list
           o Circular linked list are the variation of a linked list. 
           o In which the last node points to the first node.
